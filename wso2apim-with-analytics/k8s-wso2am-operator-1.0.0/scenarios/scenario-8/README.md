## Scenario-8 : Running External NFS

**Prerequisites**

A pre-configured Network File System (NFS) to be used as the persistent volume for artifact sharing and persistence. In the NFS server instance, create a Linux system user account named wso2carbon with user id 802 and a system group named wso2 with group id 802. Add the wso2carbon user to the group wso2.

```
groupadd --system -g 802 wso2
useradd --system -g 802 -u 802 wso2carbon 
```
    
1. Setup a Network File System (NFS) to be used for persistent storage.

    Create and export unique directories within the NFS server instance for each Kubernetes Persistent Volume resource defined in the pv.yaml file.

2. Grant ownership to wso2carbon user and wso2 group, for each of the previously created directories. 

    ```
    sudo chown -R wso2carbon:wso2 <directory_name>
    ```
   
3. Grant read-write-execute permissions to the wso2carbon user, for each of the previously created directories.

    ```
    chmod -R 700 <directory_name>
    ```

4. Update the StorageClassName in the storage-class.yaml file as you want.

    Then, apply the following command to create a new Storage Class,

    ```
    kubectl create -f storage-class.yaml 
    ```
    
5. Update each Kubernetes Persistent Volume resource with the corresponding Namespace (NAME_SPACE), NFS server IP (NFS_SERVER_IP) and exported, NFS server directory path (NFS_LOCATION_PATH) in the pv.yaml file.
      
    Then, deploy the persistent volume resource as follows,

    ```
    kubectl create -f pv.yaml 
    ```

6. Update PVC Configmap with the corresponding StorageClassName in the <KUBERNETES_HOME>/artifacts/operator-configs/pvc-config.yaml file.
